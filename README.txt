This project simulates a housing market based on the Dutch housing market in 2021. The purpose of this simulation is to provide insights into the dynamics of a housing market with limited housing availability and high demand, which results in a seller's market. The simulation is built using Python 3 and uses the mesa agent-based modeling library.
To run the simulation, you need to have Python 3 and the required libraries installed on your machine. Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the simulation by running the Simulation.py file.
The simulation takes several input parameters, including the number of agents, the initial distribution of wealth among agents, the proportion of luxury homes versus entry-level homes, and the initial price of homes. The simulation outputs several metrics, including the number of trades, the average price of homes, and the distribution of wealth among agents.
The simulation can be configured to include different scenarios, such as the inclusion of speculative behavior among agents, the impact of changes in the initial distribution of wealth, and the effects of different tax policies.
The code is organized into several modules, including the agent module, which defines the behavior of individual agents, the model module, which defines the simulation environment and the parameters of the simulation, and the visualization module, which provides visualizations of the simulation results.
I should mention that this project was a project that I worked on during my studies, and as such, it is a work in progress. While I have put in a significant amount of effort to ensure that the code is well-structured and the simulation results are informative, there is always room for improvement. Therefore, I am open to feedback and suggestions on how to further develop this project.
Additionally, I want to acknowledge that this simulation is only a start, and there are many factors that influence the Dutch housing market that are not accounted for in this simulation. Therefore, the results of this simulation should be interpreted with caution.
